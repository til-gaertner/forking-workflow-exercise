# Instructions
1. Gather the ingredients. 
2. Rub the pork butt with salt and pepper.
3. If you are using an Instant Pot, set the pot to saut√© and brown the pork butt on all sides. If you are making the pork in a slow cooker, brown the pork in a large pan on the stove before placing it in the slow cooker. Set the pork aside while you prepare the marinade. 
4. In a blender, combine the chicken stock, chipotles, pineapple, red onion, chili powder, cumin, lime juice, white vinegar, and garlic. Puree until completely smooth.   
5. If needed to fit, cut the pork butt into quarters and place it in your Instant Pot or slow cooker.  Pour the marinade over the top and cover. If using a slow cooker, cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4. If using an Instant Pot, set it to Meat and cook for 45 minutes.
6. Remove the pork from the pot and shred it using two forks. 
7. Return it to the marinade and cook in the Instant Pot or in a regular pot on the stove over medium-high heat for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly. 
8. Serve the pork with warm corn tortillas, diced pineapple, cilantro, cotija cheese, red onion, and other garnishes. 
9. Enjoy!
